                                            - Condition 1B: The existing trademark's name is semantically equivalent to the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1C: The existing trademark's name is phonetically equivalent to the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1D: Primary Position Requirement- In the context of trademark conflicts, the primary position of a trademark refers to the first word or phrase element in a multi-word or phrase trademark. For a conflict to exist between an existing trademark and a proposed trademark based on Condition 1D, the proposed trademark name must be in the primary position of the existing trademark. This means that the proposed trademark name should be the first word of the existing trademark.\n
                                                            Example:\n Existing Trademark: "STORIES AND JOURNEYS"\n Proposed Trademark: "JOURNEY"\n Analysis:\n The existing trademark "STORIES AND JOURNEYS" consists of multiple words/phrases.\n For the proposed trademark "JOURNEY" to be in conflict under Condition 1D, it must appear as the first word/phrase in the existing trademark.\n In this case, the first word/phrase in "STORIES AND JOURNEYS" is "STORIES", not "JOURNEY".\n Therefore, "JOURNEY" does not meet Condition 1D because it is not in the primary position of the existing trademark.\n
                                                            Example:\n Existing Trademark: "JOURNEY BY COMPANION"\n Proposed Trademark: "JOURNEY"\n Analysis:\n The existing trademark "JOURNEY BY COMPANION" consists of multiple words/phrases.\n For the proposed trademark "JOURNEY" to be in conflict under Condition 1D, it must appear as the first word/phrase in the existing trademark.\n In this case, the first word/phrase in "JOURNEY BY COMPANION" is "JOURNEY".\n Therefore, "JOURNEY" does meet Condition 1D because it is in the primary position of the existing trademark.\n
                                                                                                        
                                            Condition 2: Goods/Services Classification\n 
                                            - Condition 2: The existing trademark's goods/services are in the same class as those of the proposed trademark.\n
                                            
                                            Condition 3: Target Market and Products\n 
                                            - Condition 3A: The existing trademark's goods/services target the exact same products as the proposed trademark.\n 
                                            - Condition 3B: The existing trademark's goods/services target an exact market as the proposed trademark.\n
                                            
                                            If existing trademark in user given input satisfies:\n\n
                                            - Special case: If existing Trademark Status is Cancelled or Abandoned, they will automatically be considered as conflict grade low but still give the reasoning for the potential conflicts.\n\n
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies Condition 1A, 1B, or 1C, and also satisfies the revised Condition 1D (when applicable), along with Condition 2, and both Condition 3A and 3B, then the conflict grade should be High.\n
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies any two of the following: Condition 1A, 1B, or 1C (with the revised Condition 1D being a necessary component for these to be considered satisfied when applicable), Condition 2, Condition 3A and 3B, then the conflict grade should be Moderate.\n
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies only one (or none) of the conditions: Condition 1A, 1B, 1C (only if the revised Condition 1D is also satisfied when applicable), Condition 2, Condition 3A and 3B, then the conflict grade should be Low.\n\n
                                            
                                            Format of the Response:\n
                                            Resoning for Conflict: Reasoning for conflict in bullet points (In reasoning, if exact same goods, services and industries: list the overlaps, you should reasoning whether the good/services are overlapping or not including classes (if same as proposed trademark or not) and see trademark name whether identical (character-for-character) matches, phonetic equivalents, if it is in primary position (first word in the phrase) or not, if it is not in primary position (first word in the phrase) of the existing trademark it is not conflicting and standard plural forms for subject goods and goods that may be related or not. Reasoning should be based on provided information. Do not provide any kind of hypothetical reasoning.)\n\n
                                            
                                            Step 1: Identifying Potential Conflicts
                                            - What is the existing trademark?
                                            - What is the status of the existing trademark?
                                            - Who is the owner of the existing trademark?
                                            - What is the class number for the existing trademark?
                                            - What is the proposed trademark?

                                            - What is the class number for the proposed trademark?

                                            Step 2: Condition 1A - Character-for-Character Match
                                            - Does the existing trademark match the proposed trademark character-for-character?
                                            - If not, does the existing trademark form part of the proposed trademark? Specify the matching part.

                                            Step 3: Condition 1B - Sound-Alike Match

                                            - If yes, describe the visual elements that contribute to this similarity.

                                            Step 5: Condition 1D - Primary Position
                                            - Is the existing trademark in the primary position of the proposed trademark?

                                            - Does the proposed trademark exactly match the existing trademark in its primary position?
                                            - If the proposed trademark name is a single word or phrase, it must be fully presented in the primary position of the existing trademark for this condition to be applicable.
                                            - As if the existing trademark name is a single word, then condition 1D is not applicable.

                                            Step 6: Condition 2 - Class Overlap
                                            - Do the class numbers of the existing and proposed trademarks match?
                                            - If the class numbers are different, are the classes related in a way that might cause consumer confusion?

                                            Step 7: Condition 3A - Goods/Services Overlap
                                            - What goods/services and products are covered by the existing trademark?
