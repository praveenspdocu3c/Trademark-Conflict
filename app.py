                                            Condition 1: Trademark Name Comparison\n 
                                            - Condition 1A: The existing trademark's name is a character-for-character match with the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1B: The existing trademark's name is semantically equivalent to the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1C: The existing trademark's name is phonetically equivalent to the proposed trademark name.\n 
                                            - Condition 1D: Primary Position Requirement- In the context of trademark conflicts, the primary position of a trademark refers to the first word or phrase element in a multi-word or phrase trademark. For a conflict to exist between an existing trademark and a proposed trademark based on Condition 1D, the proposed trademark name must be in the primary position of the existing trademark. This means that the proposed trademark name should be the first word of the existing trademark.\n
                                                            Example:\n Existing Trademark: "STORIES AND JOURNEYS"\n Proposed Trademark: "JOURNEY"\n Analysis:\n The existing trademark "STORIES AND JOURNEYS" consists of multiple words/phrases.\n For the proposed trademark "JOURNEY" to be in conflict under Condition 1D, it must appear as the first word/phrase in the existing trademark.\n In this case, the first word/phrase in "STORIES AND JOURNEYS" is "STORIES", not "JOURNEY".\n Therefore, "JOURNEY" does not meet Condition 1D because it is not in the primary position of the existing trademark.\n
                                                            Example:\n Existing Trademark: "JOURNEY BY COMPANION"\n Proposed Trademark: "JOURNEY"\n Analysis:\n The existing trademark "JOURNEY BY COMPANION" consists of multiple words/phrases.\n For the proposed trademark "JOURNEY" to be in conflict under Condition 1D, it must appear as the first word/phrase in the existing trademark.\n In this case, the first word/phrase in "JOURNEY BY COMPANION" is "JOURNEY".\n Therefore, "JOURNEY" does meet Condition 1D because it is in the primary position of the existing trademark.\n
                                                                                                        
                                            Condition 2: Goods/Services Classification\n 
                                            - Condition 2: The existing trademark's goods/services are in the same class as those of the proposed trademark.\n
                                            
                                            Condition 3: Target Market and Products\n 
                                            - Condition 3A: The existing trademark's goods/services target the exact same products as the proposed trademark.\n 
                                            - Condition 3B: The existing trademark's goods/services target an exact or similar market as the proposed trademark.\n
                                            
                                            If existing trademark in user given input satisfies:\n\n
                                            - Special case: If existing Trademark Status is Cancelled or Abandoned, they will automatically be considered as conflict grade low but still give the reasoning for the potential conflicts.\n\n
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies Condition 1A, 1B, or 1C, and also satisfies the revised Condition 1D (when applicable), along with Condition 2, and both Condition 3A and 3B, then the conflict grade should be High.
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies any two of the following: Condition 1A, 1B, or 1C (with the revised Condition 1D being a necessary component for these to be considered satisfied when applicable), Condition 2, Condition 3A and 3B, then the conflict grade should be Moderate.
                                            - If the existing trademark satisfies only one (or none) of the conditions: Condition 1A, 1B, 1C (only if the revised Condition 1D is also satisfied when applicable), Condition 2, Condition 3A and 3B, then the conflict grade should be Low.\n\n
